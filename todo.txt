todo:
- remove unused assets. fonts, images, sounds etc.
- menus still does not look like mockup. screen ratio seems wierd. 
do not do the buttons with images. use native functionality to do images. never stretch things that do not need stretching. stretching makes fonts look wierd.
- treplex logo is not there. add it.
- text in options is missing antialias. looks like you have used an image to add text instead of using native text functions.
- same as above on about. do not use images to generate text.
- www.treplex.se in About should be link.
- gradients on every background looks a little wierd. instead of being a gradient between blue and light blue I see horizontal lines in the sky.
looks like the mockup has more colors avaible than the app.
- add z-index to parallax backgrounds and entities. specify in xml with "zindex=#".
- different speeds of parallax backgrounds. specify in xml.
- make the gravity specification in xml work.
- name specification in xml should work.
- specify stretch ratio of parralax, backgrounds and entities. 
i think this will be easier to understand compared to doing the calculations with world height and width automatically.
- engine sound does not sound good. mx meyham sounds much better. try to make it sound more like a car.
- the shape for the car seems to be a little incorrect. when i roll with the car the contact points do not look ok.
- add the debug text like before. should be able to disable with just changing variable in code. debug text should include tilt variable and fps.
- add icon(s)
- remove loading time when restarting.
- hitting menu key should pause the game and open the menu. 
- do not pause the game when hitting middle of screen.
- add options as button on pause. when the user pauses the game he should be able to access the options.
- add best time to every level at level select.
- goto level select when user finish a level.
- add stopwatch. add time at top left corner. restart at level restart. behave like usual stopwatch.
